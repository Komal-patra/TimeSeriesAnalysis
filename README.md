# TimeSeriesAnalysis
This is the Time series analysis on weather dataset

The research study is divided into two sub-section, which are Time series analysis and Logistic Regression. Part A of the study involved performing time series analysis on the ’weather’ dataset to analyse the decomposition of the components and forecast the data using five different models. The forecasting for the time series was done for an year (365 days). The best model was determined by comparing all of the time series models with one another. The best fit model for the dataset
was Simple Exponential smoothing (SES). The ”cardiac” dataset was used for our logistic regression analysis in part B, with the target variable being cardiac condition. In order to optimize the hyperparameter tuning, the logistic model was executed using the Logit function from Statsmodel in conjunction with gridSearchCV, which produced an accuracy of 76%.
